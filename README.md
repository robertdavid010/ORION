# ORION
The ORION project (Onion Routed Incentivized Open Network) is a blockchain project creating a new market for bandwidth peering over the Internet. It uses the same incentives and financial model to reward utility contributors for providing bandwidth, and a secure peer-to-peer distribution network to serve data requests.
